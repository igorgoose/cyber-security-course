ion without the depending object knowing the difference one of the most common ways a dependency is swapped out is with a mock implementation during testing you were unable to adequately test damselrescuingknightdue to tight coupling but you can easily test braveknight by giving it a mock implementation of quest as shown nexthere you use a mock object framework known as mockito to create a mock implementation of the quest interface with the mock object in hand you create a new instanceof braveknight injecting the mock quest via the constructor after calling theembarkonquest method you ask mockito to verify that the mock quests embarkmethod was called exactly once as you can see slaydragonquest implements the quest interface making it a goodfit for braveknight you may also notice that rather than lean on systemoutprintln like many small gettingstarted java samples slaydragonquest moregenerically asks for a printstream through its constructor the big question here ishow can you give slay
