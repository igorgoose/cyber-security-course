e specified initialization method is called if the bean implements beanpostprocessor spring calls its postprocessafterinitialization method at this point the bean is ready to be used by the application and remains in the application context until the application context is destroyed if the bean implements the disposablebean interface spring calls its destroy method likewise if the bean was declared with a destroy method the specified method is called now you know how to create and load a spring container but an empty container isnt much good by itself it doesnt contain anything unless you put something in it to achieve the benefits of spring di you must wire your application objects into the spring container well go into bean wiring in more detail in chapter first lets survey the modern spring landscape to see what the spring framework is made up of and what the latest versions of spring have to offer as youve seen the spring framework is focused on simplifying enterprise java development through di aop and boilerplate reduction even if that were all spring did itd be worth using but theres more to spring than meets the eye within the spring framework proper youll find several ways that spring can ease java development but beyond the spring framework is a greater ecosystem of projects that build on the core framework extending spring into areas such as web services rest mobile and nosql lets first break down the core spring framework to see what it brings to the table then well expand our sights to review the other members of the greater spring portfolio when you download the spring distribution and dig into its libs folder youll find several jar files as of spring there are distinct modules in the spring framework distribution with three jar files for each module the binary class library the source jar file and a javadoc jar file the complete list of library jar files is shown in figure these modules can be arranged into six categories of functionality as illustrat
