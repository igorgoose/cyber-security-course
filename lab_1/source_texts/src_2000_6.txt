a persistence api java data objects and ibatis sql maps springs transaction management supports each of these orm frameworks as well as jdbc youll see how springs template based jdbc abstraction can greatly simplify jdbc code when we look at spring data access in chapter this module also includes a spring abstraction over the java message service jms for asynchronous integration with other applications through messaging and as of springs instrumentation module includes support for adding agents to the jvm specifically it provides a weaving agent for tomcat that transforms class files as theyre loaded by the classloader if that sounds like a lot to understand dont worry too much about it the instrumentation provided by this module has a narrow set of use cases and we wont be dealing with this module at all in this book testing recognizing the importance of developer written tests spring provides a module dedicated to testing spring applications in this module youll find a collection of mock object implementations for writing unit tests against code that works with jndi servlets and portlets for integration level testing this module provides support for loading a collection of beans in a spring application context and working with the beans in that context throughout this book many of the examples will be driven by tests utilizing the testing facilities offered by spring when it comes to spring theres more than meets the eye in fact theres more than what comes in the spring framework download if you stop at just the core spring framework youll miss out on a wealth of potential afforded by the larger spring surveying the spring landscape portfolio the whole spring portfolio includes several frameworks and libraries that build on the core spring framework and on each other all together the entire spring portfolio brings the spring programming model to almost every facet of java development it would take several volumes to cover everything the spring portfolio has to off
